# astrodynamics

This repository contains programs created by participants of the course "Special topics in geometry -- Astrodynamics" at the University Augsburg during the Winter term 2016/17.

So far the main program consists of Python classes implementing solutions of the Kepler problem using various analytic techniques. Its purpose is to allow for a search for patched-conics solution for transfer orbits from say Earth to Mars. Further goals are implementations of search algorithms for other transfer orbtis such as one-thrust-maneuvers or homoclinic--heteroclinic low energy transfer orbits with prescribed itinerary.

To Do (28th December 2016):
* Implement collision orbits
* Fix plots of non-periodic orbits
* Implement thrust including rocket equation for optional fuel consumption
* Implement change of coordinate system
* Implement universal time approach to time-evolution
* Implement animations
